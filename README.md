```
Clone the repository using HTTPS, click "Clone with HTTPS".
```

```
Open Terminal. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.
```

```
Type https://github.com/MutuaFranklin/BlogPool and press Enter to create your local clone.

```

```
Open BlogPool, the cloned Repo in terminal and run : pip install -r requirements.txt to install the app dependencies

```

```
Run source blogVirtual/bin/activate to activate the virtual environment and ./start.sh to launch the app

```
